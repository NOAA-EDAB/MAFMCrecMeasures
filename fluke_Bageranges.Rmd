## Objective

Create a range of biomass and associated age structures for summer flounder based on the 2023 MT assessment. This will be used to parameterize a relationship between summer flounder population structure and expectation of catch given regs from the recreational demand model.

## Approach

Take the 2023 MT assessment input and output files as a starting point. Find max and min B relative to the reference point and most extreme age structures (all young, all old) from the assessment. Can we get a relationship (or eliminate unlikely combinations) of B/Bmsy and age structure that is realistic for this stock?

## Range of B/Bmsy from assessment

Mark Terciero provided the files from the 2023 MT assessment. They are in this repo in the `fluke2023MTfiles` folder:
